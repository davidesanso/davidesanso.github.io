  <li><strong>Come Rain or Shine: Extreme Weather, Climate Attitudes and Affective Polarization</strong> </li>

      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p>How do individuals react to extreme weather? In this paper, I explore the linkage between
firsthand experiences of climate extremes, such as floods and temperature anomalies, and shifts in personal opinions about climate change. Exploiting the temporal overlap between weather
shocks and survey responses, findings reveal that people react negatively
to cold extremes, reducing their pro-environmental beliefs and attitudes, while they report
more climate friendly views when the anomaly is particularly salient and positive (i.e. a heat
shock). This suggests one possible channel for the persistence of denial beliefs: a mental
model aligned with global warming, rather than climate change.The positive effect is confined to progressives, while conservatives remain more skeptical.
Moreover, I show some evidence of
learning; individuals in areas exposed to extremes in the past year are more likely to change
their views, with progressives again driving this effect. Finally, the second part of the project,
which is currently underway, explores how repeated climate experiences influence green behavior
and political decisions, exploiting the longitudinal dimension of the data, and tries to
understand why people fail to update, exploring the role of populist narratives and media bias.</p>

  <li><strong>Come Rain or Shine: Extreme Weather, Climate Attitudes and Polarization</strong> </li>
      <details style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
      <summary>Abstract</summary>
      <p> The UK has become increasingly polarized, including over environmental issues. This paper investigates whether firsthand experiences of climate extremes, such as temperature anomalies, contribute to this polarization by shaping individuals' beliefs about climate change in ideologically divergent ways. Leveraging the temporal overlap between extreme weather events and the timing of interviews in a large geo-coded panel survey, I document asymmetric effects: cold shocks reduce pro-environmental beliefs, while salient heat shocks increase them. These responses are strongly conditioned by political affiliation; progressives update their beliefs in the direction of scientific consensus, while conservatives remain largely unmoved or even reinforce their skepticism. I also find evidence of learning: individuals with prior local exposure to extreme events are more responsive to subsequent shocks—again primarily among progressives. The second part of the project, currently in progress, exploits the longitudinal structure of the data to explore the behavioral response. It examines why belief updating often fails to translate into sustained green action, focusing on the role of emotional responses, populist narratives, and media bias in moderating climate-related behavior.</p>

I am first-year PhD Candidate in Economics at [Sciences Po] (https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) (Paris, France), under the supervision of Prof. [Emeric Henry] (https://sites.google.com/site/emericmlhenry/home). 

I study topics related to Behavioural Economics and Political Economy, with a focus on climate change. More specifically, I am interested in the determinants of environmental beliefs, and how these are shaped by political and media narratives.

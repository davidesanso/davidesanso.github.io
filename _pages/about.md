I am first-year PhD Candidate in Economics at Sciences Po (Paris, France), under the supervision of Prof. Emeric Henry. 

I study topics at the intersection between Environmental Economics, Behavioural Economics and Political Economy. More specifically, I am interested in the determinants of climate change beliefs, and how these are shaped by political narratives and media.
